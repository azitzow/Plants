## Description

An app that provides the user with horticulture information on indoor plants and an option for a virtual garden.

## Application features:
<ul> 
  <li>Engineered user interface using Javascript, React, and improved user experience with responsive design techniques.</li>
  <li>Built a Sinatra API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database.</li>
  <li>CSS writing in Vanilla CSS and Tailwind</li>
</ul>

### Phase 3 Project Requirements 

- [X] Use Active Record to interact with a database
- [X] Have at least two models with a one-to-many relationship
- [X] Set up API routes in Sinatra to create and read actions for both models, with full CRUD capability for one of the models
- [X] Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions
- [X] Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your models, and create instance and class methods as necessary
